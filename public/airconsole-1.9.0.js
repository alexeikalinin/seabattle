 * - Constants: Constants you should use
 * - Connectivity: Device Ids, connects and disconnects
 * - Messaging: Sending messages between devices
 * - Device States: Setting data for a device that is readable for all devices
 * - Profile data: User profile data, including nicknames and profile pictures
 * - Active players: Setting a couple of devices as active players for a game
 * - Controller Inputs: Special device inputs like device motion
 * - Ads: Showing ads and handling their events
 * - Premium: Handling premium users
 * - Navigation: Changing games and opening external links
 * - User Interface: Changing orientation
 * - Persistent Data: Storing data across sessions
 * - High Scores: Storing and retrieving high scores
 * - Environment Events: Events triggered by the real world
